The following paper delivers a step-by-step outline of the Cauchy sequence construction of
the real numbers. While it presents all notions involved in a mathematically rigorous manner,
its main goal is to develop the readerâ€™s intuitive grasp of the topic. Many resources explicitly
state all theorems and definitions needed for performing the construction without presenting
the motivation for constructing the real numbers in such a way. As such, the purpose of this
discourse is to highlight the intuition which allows us to understand the logical basis for this
specific construction of R.

We begin by examining the idea that the real numbers are merely a completion of Q and point
out the reasons which cause the rational numbers to need appending. From there, we discuss
an axiomatic approach to said completion and explain the deficiencies of such a method.
These shortcomings are what motivate us to construct an explicit set representing the real
numbers. Our first step in this construction is to understand the idea of approximating
irrational numbers with rational sequences. We delve into the nuances of this technique
and develop the tools needed for defining the real numbers in terms of Cauchy sequences of
rational approximations. 

This paper was written with the intent of being an accessible read to undergraduate students in their early years of study and potentially very advanced high school students. It is a good first introduction to reading fromal mathematics.
